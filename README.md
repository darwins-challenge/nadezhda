## Description
This is a project used in [fly me to the moon][book], that explores genetic
programming. It models a robotic space cockroach that tries to find a source of
food.

> The cockroach moves along a line. Each turn it either takes a step forward,
> takes a step backwards, or stops.

See the [documentation][] for a detailed description.
